# Notes

If you arise any errors, it might have to do with the cookies and cache of your browser. 
I am not sure what the problem is with the cookies, but to restart everything just type on your keyboard on google chrome
[Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Del] and that brings you to your cache settings. And you need to clear both cache and cookies
in order to solve any access issues on the website.
Once again I am not sure why this is a problem, but that is my solution.

Now, to navigate the website, you can explore the homepage real quick where if you scroll down,
you'll see the first servlet which searches and displays the official language of a country you chose.

Now, to visit any other feature just click any left had nvbar tab and it'll bring you to the login page.
If you dont have any account just go to the signup page and signup.
Once you sign up, it'll bring you to the login page where you login.

After that, you are now logged in and now you can explore the website. The main function is making a post,
so that where the fun is and you can post whatever, this website won't be public for very long.

Once you post something you can click the feed tab on the left to see all the posts.

Also, the issue with the usernames on the posts, the correct username shows whenever I upload using my tomcat localhost, but 
on any other host, meaning on the apache web server, it displays the cookie name and not the username. 
Idk if this is a bug based on a bad synchronization btw apache and tomcat, but I guess it is what it is...
